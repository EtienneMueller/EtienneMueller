## Hello there 👋

I’m Etienne, an Assistant Professor for AI & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon | KMITL (CMKL) in Bangkok, Thailand.

I bridge computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, with a focus on biologically-inspired neural networks. My research explores how brain-like architectures can advance both our understanding of neural systems and the development of next-generation AI.

🧠 Research Interests: 
- Spiking Neural Networks
- Neuromorphic Computing
- Computational Neuroscience
